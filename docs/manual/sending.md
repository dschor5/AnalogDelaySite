# Sending Messages

## Text Messages
To send a text message, simply enter the text in the New Message Panel and click on the `SEND` button. You can also press SHIFT+ENTER to send the message.

Text messages can also be sent as "high priority" by clicking â€¼ instead of the regular `SEND` button. This will put a red border around the message to draw attention to its content.

Text messages may also contain Markdown formatting. See Markdown help for details.

## Audio Messages 
To record and send audio messages, click on the microphone icon. A window will pop up where you can record, preview, and then send the message. 

The audio can be accompanied by an optional text message/caption.

Based on the default settings, every 10 sec of audio recording require approximately 0.1 MB. 

```note
Google Chrome requires permission to use the microphone. If you are having problems, use the top right menu on the browser to access the Settings. Then click on the "Privacy and Security" menu, followed by "Site Settings", and then "Camera or Microphone". It is recommended that you add an exception for ECHO to allow use of the microphone without changing your default settings for other websites.
