# ECHO

**ECHO** is a web-based application to simulate interplanetary communication delays between two sites in analog or laboratory studies. It can be run in a closed network or over the Internet depending on the needs of the study or habitat environment where it is deployed. The application supports both public and one-on-one private conversations between users, with message types including text, audio, video, and data attachments.

**ECHO** was designed with features to facilitate work in high latency environments. All of these can be enabled/disabled depending on the needs of the study.

- **Message Timestamps** - Messages have a sent and expected delivery timestamp.
- **Message Delivery Status** - All messages are marked as "In Transit" or "Delivered."
- **Progress Bar** - A progress bar is used to show messages in transit.
- **Out-of-Order Indicator** - Messages that crossed paths in transit are flagged with an out-of-order indicator to alert users that they should read the messages carefully to understand the context.
- **Important Messages** - Ability to send high-priority or important messages to draw attention to them.
- **Conversation Threads** - Users can create threads to organize conversations.

Finally, since **ECHO** is designed as a research tool, it includes functionality to download archives of all conversations for post-mission analysis.
