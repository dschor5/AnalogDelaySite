Table Justification / Options
- users
    - Required to manage logins.
- conversations
    - Created for any group that is sharing discussions. 
    - Generic design to allow for many combinations, even if not implemented. 
    - TODO: Add support for parent conversation (one layer only) to support the
      idea of threads to separate conversations by topic. 
- participants
    - Separate from conversations to facilitate queries
    - Tracks last time a user read a conversation in order to 
      alart them of new messages. 
    - Although the system only has a mission-wide and 1-on-1 chats, this 
      architectuer would support the creation of custom groups as well. 
        - Not implemented as it would be difficult to transition between
          the basic and enhanced configurations as needed for this research. 
- messages
    - Track messages sent. 
    - send_time is always the same regardless on where you are
    - recv_time_hab / recv_time_mcc
        - Set depending on where the user originates. 
    - Query to display messages:
        SELECT messages.* FROM messages ORDER BY messages.recv_time_hab ASC

    - Query count new messages by conversation
    - Query get new messages for user
- msg_status
    - Separate from message to track per-user received/read status. 
    - Does not affect delay implementation as there are no "delivered" notices
      sent back to the author of a message. 
    - Only used to update user GUI and highlight what they have already read.
