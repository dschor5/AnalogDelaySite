<h3>User Accounts Overview</h3>

<p>ECHO is design to support individual accounts for each analog participant and mission control operator. 
All accounts will have access to the public chat ("Mission Chat") and also private channels for 1-on-1 
conversations with every other user.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>User Accounts</h3>
<p>Each user has the following fields:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        Username
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Unique alphanumeric strings to login to the application that identify the individual in conversation archives.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Alias
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Preferred name or callsign for each individual shown on the application but not in conversation archives. </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Analog Role
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Selects between roles for analog crew member and mission control operator. </p>
        <p><i>Note: The names for each role are derived from fields within the Mission Settings.</i></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Software Role
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Options are <code>user</code> for regular accounts or <code>admin</code> for administrator accounts. 
        Administrators can change mission parameters, delay settings, download archives, and manage user accounts.</p>
    </dd>

</dl>

<p><i>Note: There is no e-mail associated with each user account to help retrieve lost passwords because including 
it would require individuals to use a separate communication tool (i.e., an e-mail client) without delays during 
the mission. Thus, it is up to the Administrators to reset accounts as needed.</i></p>

<h3>Managing User Accounts</h3>

<p>The administrator can create, edit, delete, and reset the password for accounts. </p>

<p>Every new account is automatically assigned a default password (see <code>server.inc.php</code>) and 
users will be prompted to create a new password on their first login. Similarly, if an Administrator resets
the password for an account, the password will revert to the default until the first login.</p>

<p>New accounts created during a mission will not automatically appear on the "Conversations" panel for 
logged in users. A refresh is needed to reload the full list of active accounts.</p>

<p class="important"><b>Important:</b> Never delete accounts partway through a mission as that will delete all messages sent by 
that user and private chats with that user.</p>
