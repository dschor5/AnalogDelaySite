<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Data Management page allows Administrators to download archives, view system logs, and reset the application.</p>

<h3>Backup Conversations</h3>

<p>There are three types of backups used for different purposes. </p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        <code>Conversations</code>
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Archive of conversations saved in HTML files. Each conversation is saved in its own file and 
        contains a table listing the id, author, sent timestamp, receive timestamp, and content for every message. 
        If threads are enabled, then each thread is saved separately and identifies the converation it belongs to
        (e.g., Mission Chat). Each file identifies the conversation, participants (by <code>username</code> only), and all messages. 
        </p>

        <p>File structure:</p>
        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-folder-open"></span> archive-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.zip</div>
        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-folder-open"></span> CCCCC-conversation</div>
        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-document"></span> MMMMM-attachment1.jpg</div>
        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-document"></span> MMMMM-attachment2.pdf</div>
        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-document"></span> CCCCC-conversation.html</div>
        <p>Where CCCCC and MMMMM refer to the unique conversation and message ids respectively.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt>
        <code>MySQL </code>
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Raw MySQL dump of the entire database schema and data. These archives are intended for backup purposes, 
        but are provided to administrators in case it facilitates queries for data analysis.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        <code>System Log</code>
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>The system log records errors and warnings captured by the software (e.g., invalid queries). Moreover, 
        it saves a record of every setting changed in the application along with a UTC timestamp. This can be used
        to recreate events after the mission. It is recommended to clear the log before configuring the system 
        for a new mission. </p>

        <p><i>Note: The administrator page shows the last 20 messages recorded.</i></p>

        <p><i>Important: A copy of this log should be attach to any bug reports.</i></p>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3>Reset Applicaiton</h3>

<p><b>Important:</b> Resetting the system log or deletting all messages are irreversible steps.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Reset Sysetm Log
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Clear the system log.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Delete All Data
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Deletes all threads, text, audio, video, and file attachments, but preserves all user accounts.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>The recommended sequence of events is shown below. The order ensures that there is 
record of the mission configuration saved to the System Log at the beginning of each mission.</p>

<ol>
    <li><i>Optional</i> Create backups</li>
    <li>Reset System Log</li>
    <li>Delete All Data</li>
    <li>Configure mission settings</li>
</ol>
