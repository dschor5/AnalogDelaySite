<h3>User Interface Features</h3>

<p>ECHO allows administrators to turn on/off various user interface features to evaluate their effectiveness 
when working with interplanetary communication delays.</p>

<dl>
    <!-- Notifications --> 

    <dt>
        Sound Notifications
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Play an audio alerts for every incoming message. </p>
        
        <p>If <i>Important Messages</i> are enabled, 
        then the system uses a different sound to draw attention to those messages.</p>

        <p><i>Note: Chrome requires that users interact with the page before allowing an application to play sounds.</i></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Badge Notifications
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Connect to the operating system badge notification to alert users of incoming messages.</p>
        <p><i>Note: Users will be prompted to allow badge notifications for the application.</i></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Unread Message Count
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Display the number of unread messages on other conversations. </p>
        
        <p>If <i>Important Messages</i> are enabled,
        then the system will add red exclamation marks to show that an important message was received on 
        another conversation.</p>

        <p>If <i>Threads</i> are enabled, then the unread message count for other conversations will 
        show a cumulative total of all new messages in that conversation and its threads.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Conversation Ordering
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Reorder converstion panel based on incoming messages. </p>
        
        <p>If a new message was received on a conversation,
        that conversation will appear at the top of the list so the user does not need to scroll down to see
        if new messages were received.</p>
        
        <p>If <i>Threads</i> are enabled, the same logic is applied to reorder 
        threads on the current conversation.</p>
    </dd>

    <!-- Delay Reminders --> 

    <dt>
        Show Transit/Delivered Status
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Adds the expected received time and status to each message.</p>
        
        <p>The received time is an estimate of when the message will be delivered to all the participants 
        of that conversation or thread. Conversations that include both crew members and mission controllers
        estimate the received time by adding the sent time and the delay at the time the message was sent. 
        Whereas conversations that only include participants at one site (e.g., 1-on-1 chat between two 
        mission controllers) do not add a delay to the estimate. </p>
        
        <p>The status can be either <i>"Transit"</i> or <i>"Delivered"</i>. Note that this is not a 
        "received receipt" as that would imply a two-way delay to get a confirmation that the message 
        was indeed received.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Message Progress Bar
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Adds a progress bar to all messages in <i>"Transit"</i> (see Show Transit/Delivered Status)
        to visualize that the signal containing the message is still propagating through space and 
        has not reached its destination.</p>
    </dd>

    <!-- Message Formatting -->

    <dt>
        Markdown support
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Allows users to use Markdown to format text messages (e.g., bold, italics, lists). For details
        refer to the <a href="%http%%site_url%/help/markdown">Markdown</a> help page.</p>

        <p>Note, non-administrators will only see the Markdown help page if the feature is enabled.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Important messages
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Allows users to send <i>"Important"</i> messages to draw attention to high priority items.</p>

        <p>The important messages have a thick red border to stand out in the chat. Moreover, if sound 
        notifications are enabled, they will make a different sound to alert users of an incoming important
        message.</p>
    </dd>
    
    <!-- Conversation Threads -->

    <dt>
        Threads
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Allows users to create threads within a conversation to organize information. Each conversation 
        (sometimes refered to as parent conversation) can have as many threads as needed, but they must 
        have unique names. Threads can be created at any point during a mission and will automatically 
        appear on other user's screens without the need to refresh the screen.</p>

        <p>It is recommended to keep threads either enabled or disabled for an entire mission. However, if
        needed for research purposes, it is important to understand that no messages will be lost, but 
        rather they will be rearranged either into the parent conversation or their original threads 
        based on the following rules:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If starting amission with without threads, the menu will appear to add threads, but 
            messages will remain in the parent conversation. Only new messages sent within a thread will 
            appear in the thread itself.</li>

            <li>If disabling during a mission, the messages from all the threads are combined into the parent 
            conversation based on the received timestmaps and their ids are recalculated.</li>

            <li>If re-enabling during a mission, then any message previously sent in a thread will return to 
            the original thread, but any messages sent while threads were disabled will remain in the
            parent conversation.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Anyone can create threads
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If threads are enabled, this option selects whether administrators or all users can create new threads.
        The option was added to help organize conversations and prevent frivolous threads from being created.</p>
    </dd>

    <!-- Debug -->

    <dt>
        Debug
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Enable debugging mode where additional information is saved to the System Log. 
        This setitng should be turned off at all times unless there is a specific need as it 
        may affect overall system performance.</p>
    </dd>

    <!-- Login Timeout -->

    <dt>
        Login Timeout
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Selects how many minutes of inactivity to wait before logging out users.</p>
    </dd>
