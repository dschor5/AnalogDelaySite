<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ECHO supports both manual or automatic delays. Manual delays can be changed anytime by an Administrator, 
whereas automatic delays are configured as piecewise functions of time. The latter allows for gradual delay changes
over time to represent the transit to a distant planet and/or relative orbital position changes between two planets.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> The new delay setting does not affect messages already in transit. If a message was sent with 
delay=Xsec, that delay will be enforced even if the Administrator changes the settings to Ysec delays. However, all 
other messages sent after the new delay setting was applied will use the new delay. To avoid problems it is better 
to coordinate the time to change the delay settings during periods of low activity.</p>

<h3>Manual Delays</h3>

<p>Manual delays are defined in seconds and can be changed anytime before, during, or after a mission. </p>

<h3>Automatic Delays</h3>

<p>Automatic delays allow Administrators to define delays as a piecewise function of time.</p>
