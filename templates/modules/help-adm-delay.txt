<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ECHO supports both manual, automatic, and real-time Martian delays. </p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        Manual Delay
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Administrator sets the one-way-light-time delay in seconds. 
        Can be changed anytime before, during, or after a mission and takes effect immediately.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Automatic Delay
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Automatic delays allow Administrators to define delays as a piecewise function of time. Each piecewise component
        is defined by an equation and a timestamp when that delay will activate. </p>

        <!-- TODO: Add Example -->
    </dd>

    <dt>
        Current Mars Delay
    <dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Applies the current delay assuming direct point-to-point contact with Mars ignoring interference from the Sun,
        use of the Deep Space Network, planet rotation, etc. The delays were simulated on 4hr intervals until 2040 using 
        the <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html" target="blank">JPL DE440S Ephemeris Data Set</a>.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Important:</b> The new delay setting does not affect messages already in transit. If a message was sent with 
delay=Xsec, that delay will be enforced even if the Administrator changes the settings to Ysec delays. However, all 
other messages sent after the new delay setting was applied will use the new delay. To avoid problems it is better 
to coordinate the time to change the delay settings during periods of low activity.</p>
